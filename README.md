# Robotic-Perception and Learning - SLAM System based on V-REP and ROS
Simultaneous localization and mapping, simply known as SLAM, is the process of creating a map
of an unknown environment by using the information from the sensors while keeping track of the
location of the robot at the same time. The problem of knowing the location requires knowledge of
the map to infer about the location of the robot with respect to its surroundings. On the other hand,
the problem of building and updating the map requires knowledge of its location with respect to its
surroundings. Hence, SLAM is considered as a chicken-and-egg problem since the two output depend
on each other simultaneously. This approach finds its purpose in various application in navigation,
building maps, augmented reality, and other essential applications in robotics.
